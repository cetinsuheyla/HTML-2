      <h1>Semantic Elements-HTML5</h1>
      <p>I used to think building a webpage is all about puting things together in order to see what we want to see on the page. Learning about semantic elements more deeply gave me a deeper understanding about why there are different tags that are giving the same view on the page. Using HTML elements that have semantic meanings makes your code clean and accesible. It makes screen readers' job easier and helps other developers understand your code better.</p>

      <h2>Let's look at some of the semantic elements and their meaning:</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>&lt; header &gt;</dt>
        <dd>Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>&lt; nav &gt;</dt>
        <dd>Represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>&lt; main &gt;</dt>
        <dd>Represents the dominant content of the of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>&lt; section &gt;</dt>
        <dd>A structural HTML element used to group together related elements. Each section typically includes one or more heading elements and additional elements presenting related content.</dd>

        <dt>&lt; aside &gt;</dt>
        <dd>Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.</dd>
